## ChatCast

ChatCast PDF-to-Podcast is a lightweight Python toolkit that automates turning research papers into engaging audio episodes: it securely loads your API keys with dotenv, extracts text from PDFs using pypdf, chunks and summarizes each section via LangChain and Google’s Gemini model, transforms those bullet-point summaries into a conversational Host/Expert script for “ChatCast,” and streams AI voices through Murf to generate a ready-to-play podcast WAV file—all in a clean, modular pipeline that’s easy to customize and extend.
